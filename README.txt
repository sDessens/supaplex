is this game finished?
no, there are still a few bugs and missing features (you cant "die" yet).
this doesnt mean the game will crash, as far as i know, the game is free of crash bugs.
i quit because of various reasons, lack of instrest being one of them.

how 2 play
send supaplex.8xk to your calc.

controls
2nd to start a level
arrow keys move your characher
alpha hides the menu
hold 2nd to lay down a bomb (you need to find one first)
hold 2nd and press arrow key to remove blocks next to your charachter whitout moving.
clear to return to menu, clear again to quit.

custiom levels
drag your uncompressed file.z80 to "compress.exe", this will compress the level and dump it into ..\compressed\
then add the approcative information into "table.z80" and "levels.z80", you dont need the "ifdef" stuff.
aditionaly, if you name your custom level XXX.z80, where XXX is a number below 111, you can just modify "levelset.z80".
the  hit "app.bat" to run spasm.
the level names are in "data.z80"

what are levels.bat and table.bat?
these recreate levels.z80 and table.z80, if you entered your custom levels in here: dont run these

HELP! the game doesnt start
apparantly you dont have 200 bytes of free ram.
